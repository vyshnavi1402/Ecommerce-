# Output

I developed a fully functional e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes intuitive navigation across multiple pages, such as:

Home: Welcoming landing page with featured products and latest offers.

Shop: A dedicated product listing page, showcasing various categories with detailed product descriptions.

Blog: A space for articles and updates related to products, trends, or company news.

Contact: A form where users can get in touch for inquiries or support.

Cart: A seamless shopping cart that allows users to review, add, or remove products before checkout.

This project demonstrates essential front-end skills and the ability to create a responsive, user-friendly interface for an online shopping experience.
