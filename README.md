# Output

I developed a fully functional **e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The website includes intuitive navigation across multiple pages, such as:

**Home**: Welcoming landing page with featured products and latest offers.

**Shop**: A dedicated product listing page, showcasing various categories with detailed product descriptions.

**Blog**: A space for articles and updates related to products, trends, or company news.

**Contact**: A form where users can get in touch for inquiries or support.

**Cart**: A seamless shopping cart that allows users to review, add, or remove products before checkout.

This project demonstrates essential **front-end skills** and the ability to create a responsive, user-friendly interface for an online shopping experience.
